Question 1
- You specify the TCP socket by opening a socket.SOCK_STREAM socket, which provides a stream (i.e. ordered) flow of data
    which is why it is TCP. The exact code to specify a IPV4 TCP socket is socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2
- The server socket binds and listens for incoming connections,
    however the client socket connects and sends data, then listens for the response.
    This means the server has to bind to a host name and set socket options so that the servers port stays constant,
    otherwise it might change between connections like the client socket would.

Question 3
- Setting the socket option socket.SO_REUSEADDR to 1 allows us to reuse the port even if errors or failure
    occur during operation of the server.

Question 4
- For incoming connection we get the IP address they are coming from, and which port they connected from.

Question 5
- After I have finished handling the incoming request, I attempted to receive more data and I get an empty byte array.
